<h3>Mukimo served on a white saucer</h3>

<p>Mukimo (Moh-Kee-Moh) is a well-known Kenyan dish from Central Kenya. 
    This cuisine is much popular among the kikuyu tribe. Since the 
    introduction of potato farming in Kenya (in the 1880s by the British 
    farmers), potatoes have become a staple food for the kikuyu tribe. 
    Hence the invention of this beautiful dish called mukimo. 
    Mukimo implies squashed and the dish is fundamentally the African 
    reply to mashed potatoes. It can be found all over the whole nation, in 
    spite of the fact that in several varieties and combinations. The 
    Mukimo is made out of bubbled beans, maize and potatoes and can effectively 
    take a number of hours to plan (however its miles well worth it!). The dish can 
    also be called Irio.
