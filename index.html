    <p>The story of Kenyan cuisine is as old as the first human settlement in East Africa, of which present-day Kenya 
        is a part. Prior to Kenya becoming a British colony in the 1900s, the country had already been settled by a 
        horde of African tribes who entered the region from different directions. With them came the different dishes 
        that make up part of Kenyan cuisine as they also brought millet, sorghum, and their traditional livestock products, 
        herbs, and vegetables.

    <p>
        The second part of the Kenyan cuisine story is attributed to the arrival of foreigners, notably the Portuguese, 
        Arabs, and Indians, who settled along the Kenyan coast and later moved into the interior. With them came foreign 
        products like maize (corn), bananas, spices, and wheat, amongst others. Over time, these were used to create localized 
        dishes that have given the Kenyan cuisine the character that we have today.

    <h3>Kenya: A Culinary Story</h3>
    <p>
        Therefore, with more than <em>45 different dishes</em> from our diverse communities, made up of African, Arab, 
        Swahili, Indian, and European influences, it is no surprise that Kenya has one of the most diverse cuisines in 
        the world today. With more dishes arriving from China, Thailand, Japan, and Korea, who knows what will happen in 
        the future; we might have a new combination of Afro-Oriental cuisine, just like Afro-European or Afro-Arab foods. 
        These diverse influences provide a rich and wide range of different foods consumed in Kenya. But while some dishes 
        may be popular among certain communities or regions only, food in Kenya today tends to be a uniting factor.
