<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 and Â½ cups warm water (adjust as needed)</li>
    <li>Additional flour for dusting</li>
    <li>Extra oil or butter for frying</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable oil and gradually pour in the warm water while mixing with a spoon or your hands to form a soft, non-sticky dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8-10 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out each ball of dough into a thin, round circle using a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Brush a thin layer of oil or butter over the surface of the rolled-out dough.</li>
        <li>Starting from one end, fold the dough into a narrow strip, then coil it into a round shape like a snail, tucking the end underneath.</li>
        <li>Flatten the coiled dough with your palm, then roll it out again into a thin circle.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan or a griddle over medium heat and place the rolled-out chapati on it.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 1-2 minutes until small bubbles start to form, then flip it over and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown spots appear.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.</li>
        <li>Serve the delicious Kenyan Chapatis (Chapos) hot with your favorite curry, stew, or any side dish.</li>
